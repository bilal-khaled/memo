**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game„ÄÇ

Intro: This is a web app simulation of Milton Bradley Simon 1978 Electronic Games. 

‚≠ê This memory game had four different colored buttons. Each button played a unique note. Players had to be able to repeat an increasingly long string of tones that the buttons created. A brief video introduction is available here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLi1qnRmpe4

## Achieved Functionality

* [‚úî] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [‚úî] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [‚úî] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [‚úî] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [‚úî] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [‚úî] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [‚úî] User loses the game after an incorrect guess
* [‚úî] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [‚úî] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [‚úî] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [‚úî] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [‚úî] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [‚úî] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [‚úî] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [‚úî] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn (The newest edition timer only time the gamer after the program plays the clueSequence)

Following **additional** features are implemented (exciting ones!!):

- [‚úî] When the program plays its clue sequence, a "squirrel" pops up in the button when the button is lit. 
- [‚úî] Make the "Start" and "Stop" Button way more fancier. (Add a little sauce of Cyberpunk and Mystery!)
